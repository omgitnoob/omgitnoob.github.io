                        Trees are big plants that grow from the ground. 
                        They have strong wooden trunks, 
                        green leaves, and roots that hold them in place. 
                        Trees are very important because they give us fresh air to breathe, 
                        shade on hot days, and homes for birds and animals. 
                        Some grow fruits like apples or bananas, and others give us wood to build things.<br>
                        <br>
                        Trees come in many shapes and sizes, and you can find them almost everywhere. 
                        In parks, gardens, forests, and even by the roadside. 
                        They help keep our planet healthy and beautiful!

                                When a tree is cut, you can see a circle pattern inside the trunk, 
                                these are called growth rings. One ring means one years old! 
                                So if a tree have 10 rings that means its 10 years old!.

                                We don't want to hurt the tree as some might be the last of its kind, so scientist use other ways to find out.
                                Like measuring how thick the trunk is using a measuring tape. 
                                Some tree grows about 2.5cm per year (depending on the type), 
                                Multiply the truck the size by how much it grows in a year and this gives an estimated age! 
                                example (If he tree truck is 25cm thick and the tree grows 2.5cm per year then 25 / 2.5 = 10 year old)

                            A pine tree is a tall, green tree that looks like a giant triangle! 
                            It stays green all year long, even in winter, so it's called an evergreen tree. 
                            Instead of soft, flat leaves, pine trees have thin, pointy needles, 
                            these needles come in bunches and feel a little sharp. 
                            Pine trees don’t grow flowers or fruit like some trees. 
                            Instead, they grow pinecones, The often grow in forests and mountains. Some can grow very tall, 
                            like towers! and Some pine species are grown specifically for use as Christmas trees during the holiday season.

                            It’s easy to spot because it often has thick, twisty branches and big, wavy leaves. 
                            Oak trees are deciduous, which means they lose their leaves in the fall. 
                            They can live for hundreds of years, even over 1,000!

                            (that’s taller than a 10-story building!). In the summer, teak trees grow tiny white flowers, and in the fall, 
                            their leaves fall off. That means teak is a deciduous tree.

                            A rubber tree is a tall tree that grows in warm, rainy places like Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa. 
                            Its scientific name is Hevea brasiliensis (hee-vee-uh bra-sil-ee-en-sis). What makes it special? 
                            It gives us natural rubber! 
                            Inside the trunk of the rubber tree is a milky white liquid called latex. When people make a small cut in the bark, 
                            the latex drips out, they are made into item in our daily life such as Tires for cars and bicycles,
                            Erasers for pencils, Rubber bands, Shoes and boots, Gloves and balloons. Rubber tree can live up to 30 year which means alot of rubber.

                            Rubber tree wood is also called rubberwood. But after about 25–30 years, rubber trees stop producing latex, 
                            so instead of cutting them down and wasting them, people use the wood to make all kinds of useful things. 
                            Just like Oak and Teak, RubberWood is consider to be hardwood which makes them great for furniture and children toys and etc.
